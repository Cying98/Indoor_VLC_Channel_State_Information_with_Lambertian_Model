# Indoor VLC Channel State Information (CSI) with Lambertian Model

This repository contains the channel state information (CSI) data for indoor visible light communication (VLC) systems based on the Lambertian model. The CSI data is provided in both `.mat` files and the original source code used to generate the data. The data and code are intended for research and analysis purposes in the field of indoor VLC.

## Introduction

The channel state information (CSI) provided in this repository offers insights into the characteristics and performance of the indoor VLC channel based on the Lambertian model. The Lambertian model takes into account the directional characteristics of light propagation and is widely employed for simulating and evaluating indoor VLC scenarios.

## CSI Data Files

The CSI data files, available in the `.mat` format, can be found in the `channel_data` folder. Each file represents a specific scenario or configuration and contains the necessary information to analyze the performance and characteristics of the indoor VLC channel based on the Lambertian model. Additionally, the original MATLAB source code used to generate the data, considering the Lambertian model, is provided. Researchers can modify the code to adapt it to new requirements or explore different scenarios.

## Usage

To use the CSI data, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Access the `channel_data` folder to find the `.mat` files containing the CSI data.
3. Load the desired CSI data file in MATLAB or any other compatible tool for analysis.
4. Optionally, modify the provided source code, which considers the Lambertian model, to generate new CSI data that better suits your requirements or scenarios.

Please note that the CSI data and source code are intended for research purposes only. If utilized in any publications or academic work, proper citation of the data and code is required.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance the CSI data repository by adding additional data, measurement techniques, or analysis methodologies.
